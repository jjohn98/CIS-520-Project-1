To create the new test, I simply had to make a copy of alarm-multiple and edit it to alarm-mega by changing it to run 70 alarms instead of 7. Then, inside of tests.h and tests.c I added the code to support alarm-mega using alarm-multiple as a template. Finally, inside of alarm-wait.c I created a new function test_alarm_mega using test_alarm_multiple as a template.
